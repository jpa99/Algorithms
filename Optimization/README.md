# Optimization Algorithms
This folder contains optimization implementations for locational optimization problems. The general problem statement solveable by this flavor of optimization is as follows: Given a set S of n candidate 2-tuples (ordered pairs) and a function cost(P): R^2 --> R where P = {(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_k, y_k)}, find a subset Q of k 2-tuples (ordered pairs) such that cost(Q) is minimized. This can be reformulated as selecting k optimal points from a set of n candidate points.
